# Robustness-Enhancement-of-Machine-Fault-Diagnostic-Models
## Introduction
This is a repository of our paper "Robustness Enhancement of Machine Fault Diagnostic Models for Railway
Applications through Data Augmentation". 

Run the scripts "Augmentation.py", "test_GBDT.py", "test_ResNet.py", "test_ResNet_STFT.py" and "test_ResNet_WPT.py" for each experiment in a development environment like spyder. 

The model is built and tested with keras 2.2.4 and tensorflow 1.13.1.
